### This week's goals:

- [x] a) Device ID to be randomized and not numbers.
- [x] b) Configuration page to have sliders for different issues. So client can choose which issue is more important.
- [x] c) Client can choose which Risk Score he wants to have a look. This will also be in the Configuration page.
- [x] d) Dashboard must have a graph showing Risky devices over time.
- [x] e) Activity Timeline to be real data and not hardcoded.
- [x] f) Show the latitude and longitude in one Column, on Clicking it, it should open within a Map that shows the location. The Page should be inside the application, and could embed other service like Google maps etc.
